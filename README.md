## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science. They provide efficient ways to store and manipulate data, as well as solve complex problems. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing efficient and scalable code.

This course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to data structures and algorithms using the Java programming language. It covers various topics such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and more.

## Course Content

The course is divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific data structure or algorithm. The modules are as follows:

1. Arrays and Big-O Notation
2. Sort Algorithms
3. Lists
4. Stacks
5. Queues
6. Hashtables
7. Search Algorithms
8. Trees
9. Heaps

## What I learned

- Learn the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of data structures, so you can choose the best data structure for your data and applications
Code an implementation of each data structure, so you understand how they work under the covers
Learn many of the algorithms commonly used to sort data, so your applications will perform efficiently when sorting large datasets
Learn what’s available in the JDK for storing and sorting data, so you won’t waste time reinventing the wheel
