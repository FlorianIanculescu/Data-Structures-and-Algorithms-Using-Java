## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science. They provide efficient ways to store and manipulate data, as well as solve complex problems. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing efficient and scalable code.

This course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to data structures and algorithms using the Java programming language. It covers various topics such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and more.

## Course Content

The course is divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific data structure or algorithm. The modules are as follows:

1. Arrays and Big-O Notation
2. Sort Algorithms
3. Lists
4. Stacks
5. Queues
6. Hashtables
7. Search Algorithms
8. Trees
9. Heaps

## What I learned

- The strengths and weaknesses of a variety of data structures, in order to choose the best data structure for data and applications
- To code an implementation of each data structure, to understand how they work under the covers
- Learning about linear search, binary search, and their efficiency. Implementing these algorithms in Java
- Studying various sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, and heap sort. Implementing these algorithms in Java to perform efficiently when sorting large datasets
- What’s available in the JDK for storing and sorting data, so I won’t waste time reinventing the wheel

## Certification

Certificate of Completion: [Data Structures and Algorithms: Deep Dive Using Java](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-fd09f9bc-9fd7-45c0-a2e4-307557492192/)
